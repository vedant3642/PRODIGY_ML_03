## 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM
This project demonstrates how to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify cat and dog images. The images are preprocessed and converted into feature vectors, which are then used to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## ✅ Features:
Image preprocessing (resizing, grayscale, normalization)

Feature extraction using raw pixels or HOG descriptors

SVM model training and tuning

Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations

## Tech Stack:
Python

OpenCV / PIL

scikit-learn

NumPy, matplotlib
